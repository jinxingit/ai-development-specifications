# How to Use These AI Development Specifications

This document provides step-by-step instructions for using the AI Development Specifications in this repository to improve your AI-assisted software development workflow.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Specification-as-Code and the other specifications.

### 1. Use `Specification-as-Code.txt` as a Template

The `Specification-as-Code.txt` file is the foundation of this framework. It's a universal template that defines the entire scope of your project in a structured, machine-readable format.

To use it:
1.  **Copy the file:** Make a copy of `Specification-as-Code.txt` for your new project.
2.  **Define the Environment:** In the `[environment]` section, specify the target operating system, programming language, and other key environmental details. This ensures the AI assistant understands the technical constraints from the start.

### 2. Customize Stages and Tasks

The power of this system comes from its customizability. The default template provides common stages like `setup_and_config`, `core_implementation`, and `testing_and_validation`.

To customize for your project:
1.  **Define Your Stages:** In the `STAGE DEFINITIONS` section, add, remove, or rename stages to match your project's lifecycle. For example, a data science project might have stages like `data_ingestion`, `feature_engineering`, and `model_training`.
2.  **Detail Your Tasks:** In the `TASK DEFINITIONS` section, break down the work into specific, actionable tasks. Each task should be tied to a stage and can have dependencies on other tasks.
    -   **Be specific:** Instead of a vague task like "build the app," create detailed tasks like "Implement user authentication endpoint" or "Create database schema for products."
    -   **Assign IDs:** Give each task a unique `id` for easy reference and dependency management.

### 3. Integrate Other Specifications

The other `.txt` files in this repository are designed to be integrated into your `Specification-as-Code.txt` to provide deeper context for the AI.

-   **`Product-Requirements-Document-Template.txt`**: Use this to define the "why" behind the project. Copy the relevant sections into your specification to give the AI a clear understanding of the business goals.
-   **`Context-Engineering-as-Code.txt`**: This helps you structure the context you provide to the AI. Use its principles to write clear, unambiguous task descriptions.
-   **`Testing-as-Code.txt`**: Define your testing strategy here. You can create tasks in your specification that directly reference the testing requirements, such as `TASK "Implement Unit Tests for User Service"`.
-   **`Coding-Best-Practices-as-Code.txt`**: Establish your coding standards. You can reference these standards in your tasks to ensure the AI generates code that follows your team's conventions.
-   **`Documentation-as-Code.txt`**: Plan your documentation from the start. Create tasks for generating user guides, API documentation, and more.

## Best Practices for Writing Effective Specifications

-   **Be Explicit:** Never assume the AI knows something. Clearly state all requirements, constraints, and expectations.
-   **Think in Small Steps:** Break down complex problems into the smallest possible tasks. This makes it easier for the AI to generate accurate code and for you to validate it.
-   **Version Control Your Specifications:** Treat your `Specification-as-Code.txt` file like any other piece of code. Commit it to version control to track changes over time.
-   **Iterate and Refine:** Your specification is a living document. As your project evolves, update the specification to reflect the changes.

## Translation

This document and the other specifications can be translated into other languages to make them accessible to a wider audience. If you would like to contribute a translation, please open a pull request.

By providing clear, structured, and comprehensive context through these specifications, you can transform your AI-assisted development process from a game of chance into a predictable and reliable engineering discipline.
